# ImgProcessing
Projects on Image Processing and Computer Vision

Here I have tried to present my Image Processing Projects on Matlab, Visual Studio 
Projects, ARM-none-Linux-GNUEABI ARM NEON Assembly, x86 C & MATLAB x86.

People are free to use it, and no Third Party agreement was involved during the
development and design of the Projects.

Interested people or people with queries can contact me at: rajiv.biswas55@gmail.com

Thank you and its feels good to uphold the principles of Open Source Foundation &
Computing for the greater good of Education and Academics.

Regards,
Rajiv.
